*Testing in Java.*

## Lab 1: Testable class

A LogAnalyser class was created with an isValidLogFileName function, which:
* checks if a log file name is valid.
* if the logfile name's length is shorter than ".str"'s length, the method throws an exception.

## Lab 2: Junit testing.

Testcases were created to check the functionality of the LogAnalyser class's isValidLogFileName method:
* simple test.
* test for exceptions.
* parameterized test.
